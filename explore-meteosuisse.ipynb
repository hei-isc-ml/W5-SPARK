    "## Open Challenges with Meteosuisse data (3h30)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, you are left completely free and must explore one of these 5 open data challenges.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the four additional data challenges, aligned with the provided format:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Challenge 1: **Temperature Trend Analysis**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Motivation**: Monitoring long-term temperature trends is key to understanding the effects of climate change, especially in mountainous regions where warming may occur faster than in valley bottoms.\n",
    "- **Task**: Analyze the long-term trend in temperature across stations at different altitudes, distinguishing between valley and high-altitude locations. Investigate whether higher altitude stations exhibit different temperature trends compared to valley stations.  \n",
    "- **Expected Outcome**: The goal is to determine if there is evidence of warming and if altitude affects the rate of change in temperature over the 14-year period. You should identify key patterns and trends in temperature variation over time. You should expect to observe a rise in average temperatures, with potential variations in the rate of warming between high-altitude and valley stations. Results may reveal that higher altitudes exhibit different warming patterns compared to valley floors.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Challenge 2: **Snow Depth and Precipitation Correlation**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Motivation**: Understanding the relationship between snow depth and precipitation can provide insights into snowpack formation and potential water resources in mountainous regions. Snow depth also plays a critical role in assessing avalanche risk.\n",
    "- **Task**: Investigate the correlation between snow depth (`htoauths`, `hto000hs`) and precipitation (`rre150h0`) at different stations, focusing on both valley and high-altitude locations. Analyze seasonal variations and how snow depth responds to precipitation events over the 14-year period.\n",
    "- **Expected Outcome**: The goal is to identify patterns in how snow depth builds up in response to different levels of precipitation. You may find that snow depth at higher altitudes shows stronger correlations with precipitation compared to valley locations. The challenge will also help reveal any delayed responses in snow accumulation following significant precipitation events.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Challenge 3: **Precipitation Patterns by Wind Direction**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Motivation**: Wind direction influences the distribution of precipitation across mountainous regions, particularly in valleys versus slopes. Understanding this relationship can help in forecasting weather patterns and managing water resources.\n",
    "- **Task**: Analyze how precipitation (`rre150h0`) is distributed depending on wind direction (`dkl010h0`) across different stations. Focus on comparing the frequency and amount of precipitation during south-bound versus north-bound wind events.\n",
    "- **Expected Outcome**: The analysis should reveal correlations between wind direction and precipitation patterns, showing whether certain wind directions consistently bring more precipitation. Expect to see patterns where specific directions (e.g., southerly winds) may correlate with higher precipitation amounts due to the orographic effect.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Challenge 4: **Wind Direction and Precipitation Patterns**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Motivation**: Wind can play a significant role in weather patterns, affecting where and how precipitation occurs. Analyzing this relationship is crucial for understanding precipitation distribution in mountainous areas.\n",
    "- **Task**: Examine how wind direction (`dkl010h0`) influences precipitation patterns (`rre150h0`) across various stations. Focus on how wind direction may cause precipitation to differ between valley and high-altitude locations.\n",
    "- **Expected Outcome**: The goal is to understand whether specific wind directions lead to higher or lower precipitation at different altitudes. You may discover that certain wind directions are associated with heavy precipitation events in specific locations, potentially influencing local weather conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Challenge 5: **Extreme Events Frequency Over Time**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Motivation**: Identifying the frequency of extreme weather events like massive snowfalls, heatwaves, or heavy rainfall is critical for assessing climate change's impact and preparing for future extreme conditions.\n",
    "- **Task**: Define criteria for extreme weather events, such as significant snowfall (`hns000hs`), extreme heat (`tre200hx`), or heavy precipitation (`rre150hx`), and analyze how their frequency has evolved over the 14-year period. Compare results across high-altitude and valley stations.\n",
    "- **Expected Outcome**: The analysis should show whether there is an increase in the frequency of extreme weather events over time. You may observe a rise in heatwaves or more frequent heavy snowfall events at high altitudes, potentially pointing to climate-related shifts in weather patterns."
